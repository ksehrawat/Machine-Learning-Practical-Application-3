# Project Summary: Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions Using Machine Learning

## Objective
The goal of this project was to develop machine learning models to predict whether clients of a Portuguese bank would subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, financial, and campaign-related data. The project aimed to provide actionable insights for marketing strategies while optimizing model performance.

## Steps Taken

### Data Exploration and Cleaning:

* The dataset contained over 40,000 records with variables spanning client demographics, campaign metrics, and economic indicators.
* Replaced "unknown" values with NaN, removed irrelevant columns like duration, and normalized numerical features.

### Feature Engineering:
* Created interaction features (e.g., campaign_pdays_interaction) and binned numerical variables (e.g., age and pdays).
* Performed one-hot encoding for categorical variables and scaled numerical features to improve model interpretability.

### Model Building:

* Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM, using default parameters.
* Compared model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and training time.

### Optimization:
* Applied hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV to improve model performance.
* Refined models by selecting the top 10 most important features based on feature importance analysis using Random Forest.

### Final Model Selection:

* The Random Forest model emerged as the best-performing model, with an accuracy of 89.16% and an AUC-ROC of 77.47%.
* Optimized hyperparameters (max_depth, max_features, etc.) further enhanced performance.
