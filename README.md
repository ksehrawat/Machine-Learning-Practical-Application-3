# Project Summary: Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions Using Machine Learning

## Objective:
The goal of this project was to develop machine learning models to predict whether clients of a Portuguese bank would subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, financial, and campaign-related data. The project aimed to provide actionable insights for marketing strategies while optimizing model performance.

## Steps Taken

* Data Exploration and Cleaning:
  **The dataset contained over 40,000 records with variables spanning client demographics, campaign metrics, and economic indicators.
Replaced "unknown" values with NaN, removed irrelevant columns like duration, and normalized numerical features.
